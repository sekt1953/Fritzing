# How I make my own PCB component for Fritzing

## My Troble Designing a Component

I use inkscape to make the svg files, if you want to start making or editing components yourself, just download the svg files in my library and start customizing them, it took me a while to find a good way to make and texts give still torments me.  

I found it difficult to design my own components until I found [Fritzing SVG dimension rules](https://forum.fritzing.org/t/fritzing-svg-dimension-rules/10719) on the Fritzing Forum it led me to get the right setup in InkScape, [microMerlin's](https://forum.fritzing.org/u/microMerlin) contribution was of great help.  
The next big problem I struggled with was getting the text in the right size and position, my solution is to open the svg file in the program Geany and do a search and replace px" with ".
