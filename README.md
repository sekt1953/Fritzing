# My Fritzing Work

Here I store my works in Fritzing, I have divided my archive into two parts:

## [How I make my own PCB component for Fritzing](./How_I_make_my_own_PCB/README.md)

Here I have made a guide on how to design your own component fro Fritzing with InkScape

## [My PCB Components](./My_PCB_Components/README.md)

Here I save components that I draw myself or Others work I have maked change to, so they fit for my work.

## [My PCB Design](./My_PCB/README.md)

Here I have pcb for my Home Assistant system and for model train control.
