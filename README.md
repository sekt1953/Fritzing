# My Fritzing Work

Here I store my works in Fritzing, I have divided my archive into two parts:

* [My PCB Components](./My_PCB_Components/README.md)
  * I use to save components that I draw myself or some that I have corrected so that they fit my work.
* [My PCB Design](./My_PCB/README.md)
  * I have pcb for my Home Assistant system and for model train control.
