# My Fritzing Work

Here I store my works in Fritzing, I have divided my archive into two parts:

## How I make my own PCB component for Fritzig

* [InkScape Document Properties](./My_PCB_Components/Instructions/InkScapeDocumentProperties.md)
* [Howto make Schematic View Graphics](./My_PCB_Components/Instructions/HowtoMakeSchematicViewGraphics.md)
* [Howto make PCB View Graphics](./My_PCB_Components/Instructions/HowtoMakePCBViewGraphics.md)
* [Howto make BreadBoard View Graphics](./My_PCB_Components/Instructions/HowtoMakeBreadBoardViewGraphics.md)

## [My PCB Components](./My_PCB_Components/README.md)

* I use to save components that I draw myself or some that I have corrected so that they fit my work.

## [My PCB Design](./My_PCB/README.md)

* I have pcb for my Home Assistant system and for model train control.
