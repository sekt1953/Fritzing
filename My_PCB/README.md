# My PCB maked with Fritzing

I'm quite happy with using Fritzing to make my printed circuit boards, it can do most of what I need.

## List

## PCB Board for Home Assistant

### [PWM_Light_Controller](./PWM_Light_Controller/PWM_Light_Controler_v1_3/PWM_Light_Controler_v1_3.fzz)

The PWM Light Controller is a light controller based on an ESP32 and Power Mosfet, it also has an I2C interface where I have connected a BMP230 climate sensor.

### [occupied_sensor](./occupied_sensor/) 

Is a card to detect if there are trains on a track section, be it wagons or locomotives, the printed card has 64 inputs.

## LedDriver with optocoupler

The Led Driver printed circuit board is made with optocouplers in order to realize that many LEDs are already mounted with a common cathode, and therefore cannot be controlled with a darlington array, which needs the LEDs to be mounted with a common anode.

### [LedDriver with Darlinton array](./Darlinton_Relay_and_Led_Driver/)

The printed circuit board is a driver card for leds and relays with an common Anode (+power).
